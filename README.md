### __GO MOMMY!__


    Pregnancy can be overwhelming for mothers especially for first time moms.
    
    This application aims to accompany moms and expectant moms and help them on their motherhood journey.
    
    This application will also become a bridge to connect users to a professional specialist through 
    their nearest clinic as well as to create a safe space for them to reach out to other moms and form a dynamic 
    community intensive on the needs on their journey.
